This script was made as a prototype based on the requests made in the BWU Discord as a proof of concept. This open-source solution will remain open to the public but will likely not be maintained. It contains simple ways to navigate dialog as well as an Await condition. It also contains ways to query Items, SceneObjects, and Skills.
There will be a Premium version of this script posted to the SDN which will be maintained as time goes on and will include options such as banking, which nodes to mine, fletching / cutting toggles, etc.

Good luck with the grind!

NOTES

To change the vein you're mining, Head to the handleMining() function and change the Query from "Common gem rock" to "Uncommon gem rock" or whatever you're mining. If you want a different gem vein level such as Premium, etc. You'll need to add the gems to their respective Crafting and Fletching lists with their level requirements.
